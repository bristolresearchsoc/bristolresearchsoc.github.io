**Objective:** Socialising with the members.


**General Idea:** Get people to the pub and have an enjoyable and relaxing evening.

**Benefits:** Increase member morale and break the boundary between the committee and members.

**Summary:** It was successful. We had some good competition, the members got to know the committee and vice-versa.
