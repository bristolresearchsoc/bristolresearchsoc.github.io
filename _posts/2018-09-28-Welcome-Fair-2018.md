**Objective:** Increase awareness and membership of BURS.


**General Idea:** The idea is to showcase to freshers what we are going to be doing over the course of the year to try and peak their interest and get them to sign up for our mailing list then our group membership.

**Benefits:** Higher membership is helpful when getting sponsorship. Society development. Increased attendance at our events will encourage speakers to return.

**Summary:** It was a success with 225 sign ups for the mailing list. There was a significant increase in membership from less than 20 (in the beginning of the academic year) to 129 official members. On top of that our Facebook group currently has 430 members (acquired over the past 3 years).
