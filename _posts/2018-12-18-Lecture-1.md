“Researchers, funders and universities now recognise that UK research depends onsoftware.  92% of researchers depend on software to conduct and analyse their research.  56% ofresearchers develop their own research software.  However, 71% of researchers have no formaltraining in software development.  This has lead to a crisis of reproducibility in many fields,as it is challenging (if not impossible) for many pieces of research or analysis software to runon anything other than the laptops of the original researcher.  The career of Research SoftwareEngineering has been created to help address this problem.  Research Software Engineers haveexperience and training in both software engineering and domain research.  They help ensurethat  software  is  written  to  be  portable  and  reproducible,  enabling  software  to  be  sustainedbetween projects and shared with the wider academic and industrial community.  In this talkI will discuss what Research Software Engineers do, the growth of RSE groups in universitiesacross the country,  and provide some examples of why it is so important to change researchculture so that researchers learn and adopt core software engineering best practice (e.g.  versioncontrol and testing).”  - Dr.  Christopher Woods
